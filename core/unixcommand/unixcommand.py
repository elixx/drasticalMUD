"""
Unix-like Command style parent

Evennia contribution, Vincent Le Geoff 2017

This module contains a command class that allows for unix-style command syntax in-game, using
--options, positional arguments and stuff like -n 10 etc similarly to a unix command. It might not
the best syntax for the average player but can be really useful for builders when they need to have
a single command do many things with many options. It uses the ArgumentParser from Python's standard
library under the hood.

To use, inherit `UnixCommand` from this module from your own commands. You need
to override two methods:

- The `init_parser` method, which adds options to the parser. Note that you should normally
    *not* override the normal `parse` method when inheriting from `UnixCommand`.
- The `func` method, called to execute the command once parsed (like any Command).

Here's a short example:

```python
from evennia.contrib.base_systems.unixcommand import UnixCommand


class CmdPlant(UnixCommand):

    '''
    Plant a tree or plant.

    This command is used to plant something in the room you are in.

    Examples:
      plant orange -a 8
      plant strawberry --hidden
      plant potato --hidden --age 5

    '''

    key = "plant"

    def init_parser(self):
        "Add the arguments to the parser."
        # 'self.parser' inherits `argparse.ArgumentParser`
        self.parser.add_argument("key",
                help="the key of the plant to be planted here")
        self.parser.add_argument("-a", "--age", type=int,
                default=1, help="the age of the plant to be planted")
        self.parser.add_argument("--hidden", action="store_true",
                help="should the newly-planted plant be hidden to players?")

    def func(self):
        "func is called only if the parser succeeded."
        # 'self.opts' contains the parsed options
        key = self.opts.key
        age = self.opts.age
        hidden = self.opts.hidden
        self.msg("Going to plant '{}', age={}, hidden={}.".format(
                key, age, hidden))
```

    Unix-type commands, supporting short and long options.

    This command syntax uses the Unix-style commands with short options
    (-X) and long options (--something).  The `argparse` module is
    used to parse the command.

    In order to use it, you should override two methods:
    - `init_parser`: this method is called when the command is created.
      It can be used to set options in the parser.  `self.parser`
      contains the `argparse.ArgumentParser`, so you can add arguments
      here.
    - `func`: this method is called to execute the command, but after
      the parser has checked the arguments given to it are valid.
      You can access the namespace of valid arguments in `self.opts`
      at this point.

    The help of UnixCommands is derived from the docstring, in a
    slightly different way than usual: the first line of the docstring
    is used to represent the program description (the very short
    line at the top of the help message).  The other lines below are
    used as the program's "epilog", displayed below the options.  It
    means in your docstring, you don't have to write the options.
    They will be automatically provided by the parser and displayed
    accordingly.  The `argparse` module provides a default '-h' or
    '--help' option on the command.  Typing |whelp commandname|n will
    display the same as |wcommandname -h|n, though this behavior can
    be changed.
