Custom gametime

Contrib - Griatch 2017, vlgeoff 2017

This implements the evennia.utils.gametime module but supporting
a custom calendar for your game world. It allows for scheduling
events to happen at given in-game times, taking this custom
calendar into account.

Usage:

Use as the normal gametime module, that is by importing and using the
helper functions in this module in your own code. The calendar can be
customized by adding the `TIME_UNITS` dictionary to your settings
file. This maps unit names to their length, expressed in the smallest
unit. Here's the default as an example:

    TIME_UNITS = {
        "sec": 1,
        "min": 60,
        "hr": 60 * 60,
        "hour": 60 * 60,
        "day": 60 * 60 * 24,
        "week": 60 * 60 * 24 * 7,
        "month": 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 4,
        "yr": 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 4 * 12,
        "year": 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 4 * 12, }

When using a custom calendar, these time unit names are used as kwargs to
the converter functions in this module.

    corresponds to (hint: Interval events deal with real life seconds).

        days, month etc (int): These are the names of time units that must
            match the `settings.TIME_UNITS` dict keys.

        time (float or tuple): The realtime difference or the same
