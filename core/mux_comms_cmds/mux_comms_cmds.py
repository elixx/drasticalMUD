Legacy Comms-commands

Griatch 2021

In Evennia 1.0, the old Channel commands (originally inspired by MUX) were
replaced by the single `channel` command that performs all these function.
That command is still required to talk on channels. This contrib (extracted
from Evennia 0.9.5) reuses the channel-management of the base Channel command
but breaks out its functionality into separate Commands with MUX-familiar names.

- `allcom` - `channel/all` and `channel`
- `addcom` - `channel/alias`, `channel/sub` and `channel/unmute`
- `delcom` - `channel/unalias`, `alias/unsub` and `channel/mute`
- `cboot` - `channel/boot` (`channel/ban` and `/unban` not supported)
- `cwho` - `channel/who`
- `ccreate` - `channel/create`
- `cdestroy` - `channel/destroy`
- `clock` - `channel/lock`
- `cdesc` - `channel/desc`

Installation:

- Import the `CmdSetLegacyComms` cmdset from this module into `mygame/commands/default_cmdsets.py`
- Add it to the CharacterCmdSet's `at_cmdset_creation` method.
- Reload the server.

Example:

```python
# in mygame/commands/default_cmdsets.py

# ..
from evennia.contrib.base_systems.mux_comms_cmds import CmdSetLegacyComms   # <----

class CharacterCmdSet(default_cmds.CharacterCmdSet):
    # ...
    def at_cmdset_creation(self):
        # ...
        self.add(CmdSetLegacyComms)   # <----
```
