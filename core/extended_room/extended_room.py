Extended Room

Evennia Contribution - Griatch 2012, vincent-lg 2019, Griatch 2023

This is an extended Room typeclass for Evennia, supporting descriptions that vary
by season, time-of-day or arbitrary states (like burning). It has details, embedded
state tags, support for repeating random messages as well as a few extra commands.

- The room description can be set to change depending on the season or time of day.
- Parts of the room description can be set to change depending on arbitrary states (like burning).
- Details can be added to the room, which can be looked at like objects.
- Alternative text sections can be added to the room description, which will only show if
  the room is in a given state.
- Random messages can be set to repeat at a given rate.


Installation/testing:

Adding the `ExtendedRoomCmdset` to the default character cmdset will add all
new commands for use.

In more detail, in mygame/commands/default_cmdsets.py:

```
...
from evennia.contrib import extended_room   # <---

class CharacterCmdset(default_cmds.Character_CmdSet):
    ...
    def at_cmdset_creation(self):
        ...
        self.add(extended_room.ExtendedRoomCmdSet)  # <---

```

Then, reload to make the new commands available. Note that they only work
on rooms with the `ExtendedRoom` typeclass. Create new rooms with the correct
typeclass or use the `typeclass` command to swap existing rooms.

    Room states:
      A room state is set as a Tag with category "roomstate" and tagkey "on_fire" or "flooded"

    Alternative descriptions:
    - Add an Attribute `desc_<roomstate>` to the room, where <roomstate> is the name of the
      roomstate to use this for, like `desc_on_fire` or `desc_flooded`. If not given, seasonal
      descriptions given in desc_spring/summer/autumn/winter will be used, and last the
      regular `desc` Attribute.

    Alternative text sections
    - Used to add alternative text sections to the room description. These are embedded in the
      description by adding `$state(roomstate, txt)`. They will show only if the room is in the
      given roomstate. These are managed via the add/remove/get_alt_text methods.

    Details:
    - This is set as an Attribute `details` (a dict) on the room, with the detail name as key.
      When looking at this room, the detail name can be used as a target to look at without having
      to add an actual database object for it. The `detail` command is used to add/remove details.

    Room messages
    - Set `room_message_rate > 0` and add a list of `room_messages`. These will be randomly
      echoed to the room at the given rate.
