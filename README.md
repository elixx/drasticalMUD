[![Build Status](http://jenkins.chatsubo.local/buildStatus/icon?job=evennia)](http://jenkins.chatsubo.local/job/evennia/)

This is your game directory, set up to let you start with
your new game right away. An overview of this directory is found here:
https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Directory-Overview#the-game-directory

You can delete this readme file when you've read it and you can
re-arrange things in this game-directory to suit your own sense of
organisation (the only exception is the directory structure of the
`server/` directory, which Evennia expects). If you change the structure
you must however also edit/add to your settings file to tell Evennia
where to look for things.

From here on you might want to look at one of the beginner tutorials:
http://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Tutorials.

Evennia's documentation is here:
