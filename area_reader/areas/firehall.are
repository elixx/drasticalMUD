a fire giant~
A red-haired giant clad in steel plate stands behind the curtain.
~
Fire giants are large, powerfully built humanoids, with deep red skin
and bristling red hair covering most of their eighteen foot frames.
Powerful hands that can rend steel usually grasp large two-handed swords
or war hammers, unusable except by other large creatures. Highly trained
and organized, they are nevertheless thoroughly evil and bent on the
conquest of others.

an ettin guard~
A two headed giant keeps an eye on the different passages.
~
Ettins are often found as mercenaries in the employ of other races,
useful for their ability to detect hidden foes with their keen senses
and wide range of vision. They are not terribly bright, but are hard
workers and good fighters, if a trifle disorganized.

king snurre fire giant king~
King Snurre~
A fire giant of titanic proportions rises from his throne in anger!
~
Orange, tusklike teeth protrude from the grinning maw of this ugly
monarch, his face covered in bright red bristles as tough as iron. 
Immensely powerful muscles ripple beneath the black iron plate that
covers his scarred torso, and his huge fists clench a flaming sword
as long as a tall man. Fabulous gems glitter in his iron crown, which
covers most of his massive head. This fellow appears powerful, but
hardly a tactical genius. Surely he cannot be the power behind the 
troubles?

One of the Queen's serving maids awaits her Queen's orders.

This sour woman is one of the Queen's many maidservants, who wait on
her night and day, slavishly attending her every need. They are cautious
of intruders, but not immediately hostile, assuming that if the intrusion
was uninvited then the guards would have dealt with it by now. Arrogance
in their own ability is a failing of all giant races, most especially
those of fire.

This loathsome creature looks like something out of a horrid nightmare.
Her garish makeup does little to conceal her hairy, bloated features,
topped by bright orange hair that appears to move with a life of its
own. Blubbery limbs threaten to suffocate furniture they rest upon,
enveloping it in layers of fat bristling with red hair that could cut
steel.

the undisputed head of Eilservs, the most powerful in Erelhei Cinlu.
In an unprecedented display of cohesive organization, the drow have 
managed to control and coerce the giants into their war on humanity, 
and to reap the spoils of the victor. Eclavdra will be infuriated at
any who hinder her grand scheme. Such lawful planning is against the
chaotic nature of the Drow, and as such Lolth has abandoned them, so
they now worship an Elder Elemental Deity.

The masterminds behind the giant raids, these drow are, despite their
slender appearance, highly skilled warriors that could easily defeat
several of the doltish giants on their own. Only their small numbers,
and dislike of the surface, makes them rely on these oafs as shock

Fire giants are large, powerfully built humanoids, with deep red skin
and bristling red hair covering most of their eighteen foot frames.
Powerful hands that can rend steel usually grasp large two-handed swords
or war hammers, unusable except by other large creatures. Highly trained

Messengers from the frost giant Jarl bear ill tidings for Snurre.
~
Sent by the frost giants to inform Snurre of the destruction of their
glacial citadel, these giants are low in morale, and hold little hope
for their plans, as both they and the hill giants have already been
put to the sword by skilled adventurers, leaving only the fire giants
to carry out the schemes of their dark masters.

brazzemal ancient red dragon hellfire~
Brazzemal~
Clouds of flaming gases coalesce into a hellish vision of death...
~
Hellfire from the lowest pits of Hell, Brazzemal, scourge of humanity,
was imprisoned here by an Ice Mage decades ago. To release him would
spell doom for most of the civilized world. The clouds of burning gas
that surround him make it difficult to judge just how big he is, though
he is certainly twice the size of any other dragon you have faced. Dark
eyes glare balefully at any who intrude upon him; even in this prison,
his arrogance remains undiminished.

shines through the pen of whoever scribed this ancient text, and quickly
becomes tiresome, as chapter after chapter of this impossibly thick book
drones on and on about his greatness. Just as you feel you may have to
prop your eyelids open to keep from falling asleep, your attention is
drawn to a carving in a hall, a hall that resembles many of the chambers
found in the citadel of the fire giants. Under the illustration is the

Slabs of Obsidian~
A narrow ledge projects from this spire of black rock, near its summit.
Rivers of lava churn below, making it impossible to proceed there, even
with flight; the waves of heat would sear the skin of a dragon. A pair
of huge obsidian valves are set in the northeastern wall of the spire,
locked, barred and covered in intricate runes which are indeciperable.
Heat radiates from their surface, and a series of glowing red runes are
an indication that magical wards may be in place here too. What is most
disconcerting about these portals is that they are nearly thirty feet
in height- what manner of beasts must reside within...?

southwest. The ceiling must be at least forty feet high, the width of
the corridor doubly that. The entire hall dwarfs any visitors, save for

The Throne Room of the King~
A subtle change begins to become evident in the stonework as the hall
nears the throne of the king. The floor begins to rise slightly, and
the walls, rather than being covered in tapestries, are decorated with
colored stones, forming detailed mosaics of superior quality to the
garish wall hangings. The mosaics depict a giant of incredible strength
rending foes of various races, especially dwarves. Giants both hate and
fear this diminutive race, for they have battled ferociously in the past.

Five iron statues flank the broad white-veined marble dais that the

ceiling, though these are obscured by two more iron chandeliers. A
flaming skull flanked by iron cressets hangs suspended behind a throne
of truly enormous proportions. Waves of heat radiate from this skull,
bathing the inhabitants of this chamber in its warmth. Several skeletons
are nailed to open spaces on the walls, scraps of flesh still hanging
from their bones. Flickering light from burning gases casts a ghastly
illumination on these rotting remains.

Lair of the Pyrohydra~
Coiled sinuously around a large pile of shining metals is a mighty red
dragon, its scowling visage peering out at those who stumble into its
lair. For a split second you expect to be roasted where you stand, but
then you realize that the dragon is but a disturbingly lifelike carving,
cleverly fashioned from the reddish stone by a master artisan. The pile
of metal is quite real though, and includes gold, silver and jewelry.
Doubtless this booty is protected from becoming some greedy adventurer's
haul by some other guardian... After all, who was responsible for the
flayed and mutilated corpses that are now visible hanging from spikes
set into the walls?

The furniture in this spacious chamber is all of ebony- even the large

iron cressets. Shadows flicker and dance, cast by the torchlight and 
small explosions of natural gas. A long shelf opposite the bed is lined
with the skulls of enemies slain in battle by the great king, and among
their number are skulls of creatures as mighty as giants and trolls, as
well as many dwarves, elves and mannish folk. Several giant iron weapons
hang from hooks set in the stonework, each of them bearing signs of heavy
usage. Several low tables covered with worthless junk surround the bed,
as do two ebony chairs, where the king prefers to sit when regarding his
treasures. An iron statue stands in the northwest corner, apparently 
serving no purpose other than to fill this empty space.

to quarter elsewhere, for there is no sign that he has had a hand in
the decor of this place, though it does share his taste for the vulgar
and garish. Lewd tapestries depicting giantesses coupling with a wide
variety of species decorate the walls, inducing queasiness in those 
who regard them, though a troll may find some of the giantesses of 
some interest. Open passages lead north and west.

The entirety of this large chamber is lit and heated by roaring blazes
in several bronze braziers, arranged haphazardly around large tapestries
of great lewdness but little material worth. It would be a fair call to
say that what fire giants lacked in artistic skill they more than make up
for in enthusiasm- this chamber alone boasts dozens of tapestries and wall
hangings of other materials, depicting every subject under the sun. A bed
that appears to be surprisingly soft and comfortable rests near an open
wardrobe filled with ugly red garments. A large mirror casts disconcerting
reflections of the rooms occupants, and a series of chests and caskets near
the mirror apparently contain the Queen's personal effects.

This chamber is filled with piles of furs that serve as bedding for the
many maidservants, and the walls boast the garish wall hangings that by

Much of this hall is hazy with smoke, produced by the many smoldering
brands set in cressets hammered into the obsidian walls. While such
smoke doesn't worry the giants, it causes great discomfort to those 
unused to such conditions. Chambers that are overpoweringly warm are
considered 'chilly' by fire giants, and as such most of this hall is
unbearably hot, heated by burning gases or braziers stacked with coals.
Two iron doors reflect torchlight to the north and east. The eastern

The King's Private Chambers~
The doors open onto a trophy room of sorts, boasting a series of sets
of arms and armor, arranged about the standard lewd tapestries and
skulls. Low shelves are piled with assorted junk, of little worth 
save to an avid collector of fire giant artifacts. The roof is covered
with the flayed hide of a chimera, slain for disobedience by the king
himself. More trophies surround a large bed to the east, while to the
west the iron doors bar travel to the rest of the hall.

Several broad passageways run from this point, heading in various
directions into the fire giant capital. Footsteps can be heard in

place. The smell of cooking meat issues strong from the west, while
to the north and east shouted orders can be heard, accompanied by
the heavy tread of several pairs of giant feet.

A Disturbing Odour~
Wafting in from a large chamber to the south is a smell that you are
well accustomed to; the stench of burning flesh. This flesh, however,
is not burning on the funeral pyre, or the battlefield, but over a
hot fire, and is due to serve the giants as their next meal. Several
humanoid races are considered delicacies by this brutal race, most
especially halflings and of course their natural enemy dwarves. The
door to the north presumably leads to the pantry, though you balk at
what you may find in there.

Hall of Giantish Culinary Delights~
It's debatable which sight in this slaughterhouse that passes as a 
kitchen is the most disturbing. The skinned halflings that have been 
spitted alive and now slowly rotate, screaming, over a roaring blaze,
or the row of dwarven heads, the tops cf their skulls removed and their
brains scooped out, and laid in bowls beside them. The rows of razor
sharp knives lining the bloodstained walls are not a comforting sight,
and nor is the huge cooking pot that could boil four humans alive, if
there was the need. The stench is overpowering, though it may hold some
appeal to a troll. A chute near the cooking pot is used to dispose of
rubbish and misbehaving servants. It leads to a lava bed deep below.

The entirety of this room is crammed with all manner of foodstuffs,
including smoked fish, cheese, sausages and ham, loaves of dried bread,
barrels of grain, and barrels of wine, mead, ale and beer, all for the
consumption of the fire giants. Freshly slain prey is usually cooked 
and served immediately, so these supplies are rations for expeditions

The King's Council Room~
The majority of this chamber is dominated by a long table, covered in
crude maps and battle plans, and lined by six wooden chairs, each sized
to seat a giant, though not necessarily of the same type. Animal hides
cover the walls, trophies of the hunt, and several scroll racks in the
corners are laden down with maps and other documents. The operation of
the giants appears to be well planned and organized, more competently
than you would have thought possible. The maps, while scribed with an
unskilled hand, depict the major human settlements, from Shadowport to
Kusnir, and Darkhaven itself. Large Xs on the maps mark where raids have
been made, while question marks presumably mark potential targets. One
such mark lies above Starhaven, another above Qetag's Reach, a dwarven
settlement.

wall, depicting various uninteresting giant legends, and past victories,
naturally embellished to the point of hopeless inaccuracy. Giants can

of Snurre, flanked by rampant hell hounds, their breath forming a
halo around the skull. Flickering torchlight makes the reddish metal
appear to be aflame. No sound can be detected from behind this large
and imposing portal, though it is so thick it would be hard to hear

The End of the Hall~
This point marks the end of the divided hallway that runs south through
the center of the citadel, linking most of the important areas. Traffic
is likely to be heavy here, and the guards observant; while intruders 
are not common, Snurre is well aware that efforts will be made to stop 
his schemes, and has taken appropriate cautionary measures as necessary.
A long iron cylinder hanging from the far wall appears to be an alarm of
some sort, to be struck if an intruder is sighted. The noise would most
likely bring any giants within earshot running, though the halls are so
massive that the sound could not hope to carry very far.

This small chamber boasts a desk, covered in maps and papers, and a
high chair, enabling someone of lesser height than the table was 
initially designed for the opportunity to reach what lies atop it. A
second chair, sized for a giant, rests near the desk, as if whoever
sat there wished to observe the work in progress on the desk. Cases
laden with giantish documents line the walls, while several plaques
in dwarven also can be seen, most of them carved with messages that
are meant to inspire effort and elicit greater results. These simple
motivational items would be of no use to a giant as few indeed know
the dwarven tongue. Who, then, works here?

Several of the halls that run through this citadel converge at this

making their way down each of the passages. The statue itself flickers

with elven tapestries, of fine quality, and the ceiling is obscured by
translucent cloths, through which a dim light is pleasantly diffused about

The Lava Bed~
That wasn't very bright. The second you hit the lava, you are vaporised,
though the heat rising in waves from the lava had seared the flesh from
your bones long before you actually made contact with the substance.

Your belongings are reduced to slag in seconds. Way to go.

A Torchlit Corridor~
This corridor is reasonably well lit, and provides access to a series
of chambers to the east, where presumably more giants and their many
servants are quartered. There are few passers-by in this section of
the citadel, for the majority of the level contains little of interest
to the general population of the citadel. The walls here are also
unadorned, for there are few people to impress with them here.

A Broad Corridor~
This corridor is lit by torches set in iron cressets at regular intervals
along each wall. The smoke fills the upper third of the corridor, as
there is nowhere for it to escape to. The smell almost disguises the odor
of raw meat, and excrement. While giants are not filthy creatures, many of
those who serve them are, some of whom evidently reside to the north in a
foul smelling chamber.

This polluted den serves as the residence of the ettins quartered in
the citadel, most of whom serve as guards upstairs, for they are able
to sense intruders that could easily slip past the giants. Piles of
stained furs cover the floor, along with smashed jugs of watered wine
and piles of meat, chunks of it torn from victims while they were yet

This room is well furnished, with several cots, chests and a low table,
as well as a large number of boulders, stacked next to cases of wine 
and barrels of giantish ale. Sacks filled with dried meat lie next to
the table, indicating that whoever lives here does not share the fire
giant's taste for fresh prey. Little of it, however, appears to have
been eaten. Most of the items in this chamber are far too heavy for a
human to even budge; a troll would have to strain to lift one of the
boulders.

Ducking under the flayed prisoners that hang from chains set in the
ceiling, you pass into a cluttered chamber filled with instruments of
pain of every conceivable sort. Large racks rest next to racks which
are stacked with rods, bats, whips, chains, pliers, tongs, branding
irons and the like, while a large iron maiden sits open in the far
corner, near a deep well that plummets far down to a natural spring.
A table and two chairs rests near the entrance, where the practitioners
of the bloody trade of torture that is carried out here may rest between
sessions in their hellish workshop. Cries and moans are elicited randomly
from those unfortunates suffering here, all of whom are damaged beyond 
hope of healing.

Three corridors meet here, each running past rows of cells, which
house various prisoners of the giants, held for punishment, ransom or
awaiting sacrifice. Howls and shrieks echo from all around, which is
not unusual in such a place of suffering. A set of steps descends a

those kept within the cells to either side.

to investigate, noting also that the ceiling here is stark white, in

The entirety of this chamber is lit by smokeless black candles, set in
sconces of silver and gold on the obsidian walls. Purple cloth hangings
obscure most of the walls, while the floor is covered with a thick black
carpet. Two black couches flank an onyx table, laden with silver ewers
and pitchers, and platinum bowls of fresh fruit and sweetmeats. Incense
burns sweetly in a holder at either end of the table, while under the 
table can be seen coffers enameled and inlaid with jasper, brimming over
with herbs and spices. Two cupboards piled with priestly robes rest to
either side of a brocaded wall hanging woven from a disgusting series of
colors, which, combined with the cloying smell of the incense, makes you
feel rather ill. More coffers piled with gems rest atop these wardrobes,
though the jewels are of little worth.

This chamber is the private sanctum of the high priestess, and the
mastermind behind the giantish raids on the civilized races. Here is
the heart of the evil you have pursued! Smoky braziers exude a rather
foul, nauseating stench of decay, while lurid purplish tapestries of
demonic images cover the walls. A large bed rests near the far wall,
complete with hand and foot restraints; above this hangs a particular
tapestry of inestimable foulness. A large wardrobe takes up much of
the eastern wall, and it is stuffed with worthless ceremonial robes.
Coffers packed with spices and semi-precious stones rest on numerous
benches and tables, while a pair of divans flank a floor length mirror,
which reflects the entire room. A low chest rests underneath one of
the divans, and appears to be unlocked, as no locking mechanism is
visible. Jars of liquers and fine wines rest on another table, along
with jewelled earthenware plates, and burnished platinum decanters.

This corridor is dimly lit by guttering torches set in cressets high

the guard chambers to the north, from which a foul, foul smell exudes.
Additionally, a corridor slopes steeply downwards to the lowest level
of the citadel, where a range of malevolent beasts undoubtedly lurk.
Various creatures can be made out to the north, prowling about in the

The End of the Corridor~
The corridor ends here, before two doors that are, unlike most of the
cell doors, crafted from metal; in this case a black alloy of a type
that is not familiar to most races, for it is forged only in the dark
lairs of subterranean races such as the Duergar and Drow. This super
hard adamantium is also used in the manufacture of weapons and armor
by the dark folk.

This dimly lit chamber houses the guards that are assigned to keep an

with dice, small change and food, while hooks and pegs set into the 
wall between smoldering brands support cloaks, capes, satchels, vests
and furs. Kegs of wine, mead and spirits lie scattered about the floor,
evidence of the ample amounts of free time these fellows have. A loose
stone on the floor near the east wall appears to have been dislodged
by a careless giant.

emanates a sicky sweet stench. Fat black candles burn with lavender
flame atop the altar, while a series of hollow cylinders hang from a
long rod behind the altar, evidently to be struck during some obscene
ritual. Howls and shrieks can be heard at frequent intervals, their

The stairs descend to a rough hewn tunnel, that worms its way through
the rock of the volcano to the northeast. This is the lowest level of
the citadel, closest to the lava bed, and the heat even here is almost
unbearable. It is amazing that the giant's allies can stand to be in
this lair. The walls here are deeply scored, doubtless by the claws of
trolls, en route to various assignments. No light sources are present

This section of the caverns is dominated by a massive red portal, set

chains criss cross its glowing surface, which radiates intense heat,
making it impossible to approach without suffering injury. There does
not appear to be a way to open it, nor does there seem to be a really
compelling reason to do so; the door radiates evil as well as heat. A
roasted corpse, a gnoll perhaps, lies next to the door, burned to a
crisp when it attempted to broach the valve. A faint whispering, as of
a thousand voices, echoes about the door, its source unclear.

At this point a rock pool fills most of the corner of this cave, fed

acoustics in the cavern are superb, and the simple sound of a water
drop hitting the pool tinkles like the music of a skilled elven bard.
The water is dark, and has a strong mineral odor, but is probably 
quite palatable. Doubtless numerous denizens of the dark come here to
drink.

The stench that assails your nostrils as you advance down this corpse

odor. It is said no creature save the troglodyte can produce such a

to the sword without delay by the offended surface dwellers. No light

would almost be preferable to be back in the freezing wastes of the
Jarl's Rift.

The End of the Journey~
At long last the tunnel ends, the final few metres filled by a huge
skeleton, the remains of the clawed reptile that burrowed through
the solid rock so many centuries ago. In life, the beast must have
been at least one hundred feet long, perhaps more, with claws large
enough to tear down fortifications with a casual swipe. Zoologists 
from Maritshome may well marvel at such a specimen, but to you it
holds little value.

Further into the Darkness~
Northwards you plunge, deeper underground, and further into the ever-
present gloom that by now bothers you less than the thought of what
really does crawl about down here in the darkness. Drow, trolls, giants
and even worse creatures you have seen; what else remains down here?
Voices from up ahead may well herald the arrival of a new threat... It
seems every being that lives down here is intent on destroying you!

A Choice of Passages~
At this point a narrow, twisting tunnel winds into the darkness to the
west, and from this direction voices raised in argument can be heard.
No noise can be detected to the north or south, however, and light is
absent in each direction, not surprisingly. Large black bats swoop 
high above you, through the maze of outcroppings that decorate these
cavern roofs, disturbed by your arrival.

A Winding Passage~
This tunnel is cramped and narrow, allowing no more than two or three
creatures to move through at any one time. Strange growths cover the
jagged walls, which tear at clothing and skin when you accidentally
bump into them during this difficult journey. Whomever lairs within
these tunnels is certainly unlikely to receive many unexpected guests!

A Secret Base~
The cramped tunnel ends suddenly, opening onto a broad cavern, which
is filled for the most part with supplies and sleeping gear for at
least six people. Weapons and armor lie neatly arranged on flat rocks,
while a table surrounded by six chairs rests in the middle of this
chamber. Plans and maps cover the table, while several hastily hung
tapestries on the walls depict the surrounding terrain. Whoever lives
here is certainly planning for something, but whether it is in concert
with or opposition to the drow without is another matter entirely.

A Jeweled Cavern~
The illumination from your light strikes hidden formations set in the
walls of this cavern, and as you enter further it is bathed in a
glittering, sparkling light, as of a stream of gems cascading down
the walls. The spectacle is stunning in its beauty, and in what it
indicates about the tremendous amounts of natural resources that may
one day be plumbed from the depths of this volcano. Dwarves or even
orcs could easily mine most of this cavern in a few weeks, and make
a staggering profit, if they could get past the dozens of sentries 
and wild beasts that prowl the darkness.

A Short Passage~
This passage, while not equal to the finished corridors of the upper
levels, is nonetheless better formed than the rough hewn chambers or
natural tunnels to the south. There has been a notable attempt to
eventually make this a proper passageway; cressets have been set in
the walls, though they lack torches. Warm air comes in waves from 
the west, indicating perhaps that you are nearing the heart of the
volcano.

Wiping sweat from your hot face, you begin to pant slightly as you
near the source of the red glow that is now visible to the southwest.
The walls here are suffused in the reddish glow, and you find it much
easier to see without relying on your light source. A narrow cavern
lies to the northeast; it appears deserted, and filled with barrels of
supplies.

This circular cave is lined with barrels of supplies, that surround
a glowing pentacle in the center of the floor; evidently a component
in some sort of transportation spell. Perhaps here you may be able
to effect magical transport between yourself and the outside world?
Evidently someone, undoubtedly the drow, uses this room for a similar
purpose, though their aid undoubtedly comes from somewhere further
below...

The River of Lava~
Waves of heat issue forth from the flowing, churning river of red hot
lava that chugs past to the northeast, cutting through this passage
and seperating it from the far side, where you can see it continues.
A rope bridge has been strung high above the lava, the magical strands
treated so as not to catch fire from the heat or the occasional burst
bubble in the river below. The entire chamber is bathed in a hellish
glow; this surely must be what the underworld looks like; when people
perish and are sent hither, they would be advised to take some sort of
protection against the heat. The ledge you are on continues a short
distance to the south.

The ledge ends here, where it slopes down to enter the river. The
heat radiating from river is almost overwhelming. In fact it IS
overwhelming; it requires a great deal of stamina to withstand the
furnace temperatures you are being subjected to. What manner of
creature could withstand such an environment?

The Rope Bridge~
Teetering dangerously on the narrow strands of the bridge, you curse
as you realize that this bridge is not as sturdy as it seemed from
the ground. While it can support the weight of a lightly clad drow
scout, an armored adventurer bearing loot is another matter entirely.
It bucks and sways as you stagger back and forth, endeavouring to 
maintain your balance. The far side of the river beckons, almost in
a mocking fashion, as if intimating you will plunge into the roaring
torrent of lava below before you will ever reach the far side. Even
here the heat is almost killing you; you cannot imagine what would
happen were you to plunge into the fiery molten rock that flows past
below you.

It is with a palpable sense of relief that you finally achieve the

spilled you into the river that warms you even from here. A dark tunnel
beckons to the west, while a short distance to the north you can see a
cavern filled with tables, chairs and maps. Voices echo all around you;
you apparently have passed into some sort of private headquarters, and
will not be welcome!

A Dark Passage~
As the tunnel moves away from the lava, it descends sharply, and the
air becomes cooler, to the point where for the first time in ages
you once again feel the need for a cloak. No light permeates the area;
it is pitch black. Even your light cannot penetrate very far, managing
only to illuminate strange rocky formations, certainly not volcanic,
and you realize you are passing beneath the volcano, and away from it,
and further into the mysterious realm of the Underdark, the home of
the drow. This must be where they arrived from, and drew reinforcements.
To proceed further will mean encountering more of this dangerous and
unpredictable foe, and their strange allies. And while Eclavdra and her
minions worship the Elder Elemental God, the bulk of the drow houses yet
adhere to the tenets of Lolth, the terrible demoness who is their deity.
And she will certainly not be pleased that not only has Eclavdra deserted
her, but has also caused foreign surface elements to pervade her realm.

Through a tunnel crowded with stony formations you pass, heading ever

store for you...?

Council Chamber~
Dim light from several magical globes that bob about the ceiling cast
sufficient illumination through this small cavern, which is dominated
by a large slab of obsidian, flanked by several high backed chairs.
Several drow could meet here, in safety and seclusion, for even a giant
would be vaporized by the river of lava, and would have no hope of
effecting a crossing. Maps on the wall reveal the full scale of the
drow's efforts to incite the giant races to violence against humanity
and other races, and there can now be no doubt as to who the true 
mastermind is- Eclavdra. She and her house have been set back in their
plans, however, by your meddlings, and will not be pleased by this new
development. But to truly lay this threat to civilization to rest, will
simply slaying Eclavdra be sufficient...?

You find yourself suddenly standing in a large cavern, assaulted by
waves of blistering heat and blinding red light. Shrieks and howls
echo in from the northeast, while a fiery portal to the south opens
onto a barely visible cavern, somewhere in the spire. Wrenching pain
stabs at you, and you find it impossible to speak or concentrate 
enough for spellcraft. Your mind is reeling, you cannot stand up as
you'd like, and you can barely even remember who you are. All that 
is clear is that you are near the heart of an ancient evil, and it
knows you are here...

A Yawning Chasm~
A deafening roar assaults your ears as you pass into this windswept
area, and with horror you suddenly notice that you are standing in
mid air, hovering above a yawning chasm, from which unearthly cries
and shrieks echo, causing you pain and confusion. Despite your panic
you do not plummet as expected to your death; some magical force is
apparently preventing it. The howling almost distracted you from the
true evil in this unearthly dimension you have passed into, the vile
beast responsible for the scores of scorched bodies that are staked
to the walls, some still wriggling or moaning as maggots devour the
exposed organs that dangle from their rended abdomens.
