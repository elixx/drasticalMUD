Like all the giantish races, the hill giants supplant their relatively
small numbers with large volumes of troops of other races, most notably
ogres, trolls and gnolls. These mercenaries serve well as long as they
are paid and fed, and the odds are stacked in their favor. They are not
as powerful as giants, but are still very tough and strong.

The giants use these keenly aware bloodthirsty predators to add an element
of terror to their raids; a giant brandishing a club at you is one thing,
a slavering wolf eight feet high is quite another. They make excellent 
scouts as well as guards, due to their keen senses.

A massive, hirsute humanoid sits playing cards and drinking.

Smelly, foul-tempered and cruel, bugbears are eight foot humanoids,
goblinoid in nature and almost ursine in appearance. They are a crude
race used as thugs and guards by other, more intelligent species (though
in this case the margin is slim indeed...). These bugbears appear to be
quite well-armed though, with weapons obviously of non-giant manufacture.

bugbear sleeping~
a bugbear~
A foul-smelling bugbear is sleeping off a bender.
~
Smelly, foul-tempered and cruel, bugbears are eight foot humanoids,
goblinoid in nature and almost ursine in appearance. They are a crude
race used as thugs and guards by other, more intelligent species (though
in this case the margin is slim indeed...). These bugbears appear to be
quite well-armed though, with weapons obviously of non-giant manufacture.

Standing Before the Steading~
At this point the path ends abruptly, before the great oaken portals
that herald the entrance to the Steading, presumed lair of the fecund
hill giants. The source of the raiding parties that have been lately
befouling this region is at hand; it is with grim determination that
you tighten your grip on your weapon and prepare to put an end to 
their reign of terror. Gazing upwards, you see the great doors merge 
into the wooden walls of the steading, towering high overhead. Such a
large structure must surely contain several dozen giants, but despite
the risks, onwards you must press!

A Spacious Cloak Room~
Stretching along the southern wall of the great hallway you pass into
is a coat rack, from which depend dozens of cloaks, furs, capes and
large satchels, containing the worthless junk accumulated by these
brutish giants in their travels. Any items of worth are doubtless by
now sequestered elsewhere; a search here would be pointless. The wall
to the north is lined with doors, three to be precise, spaced evenly
along the wall as it heads west. Peering into the gloom, you see only
sporadic lighting, cast by sputtering tar-soaked switches.

A Spacious Cloak Room~
The hallway continues, dominated at this point by another set of doors,
equal in size and majesty to those that barred entrance to this place.
A great deal of noise issues from behind this portal, which may or may
not be an incentive to proceed in this direction. The air is warm, and
carries a strong odor of sweat mingled with a slight stench of decay,
emanating from several uncured hides piled here. To the west, a flight
of steps leads up into a guard tower.

The Base of a Guard Tower~
The hallway ends here, at the base of a set of stairs, that wind up
into the interior of a watch tower, doubtless a vantage point that
enables the giants to spy upon visitors to the steading. Apparently
the giants stationed within are remarkably unobservant, for no alarms
have been raised thus far since your entrance. The third of the three
doors lining the northern wall lies directly before you. A faltering
light is cast by a flickering brand affixed to the stair.

This spacious guard post boasts two beds, a small table, and several
piles of furs and hides, used for comfort and warmth by those who are
stationed here. A large ring of iron hangs from the roof, and next to
it dangles a bar fashioned from the same- a primitive, but effective,
alarm. The heady aroma of spilt ale is strong here, and may explain
the lethargy of the guards within this tower.

At this point a featureless corridor joins a door to the south, and a
junction to the north, each direction for the moment devoid of any
visible habitation. A single door is set into the wooden wall here, to
the west, bearing a large iron handle and a strange symbol. Evidently 
a giantish rune, only other hill giants would be able to deduce what it
symbolizes.

This large chamber is three times the size of the rooms commonly seen
in inns and taverns across the empire, but then again its inhabitant
is proportionately larger. Evidently the abode of a giant of some
importance, it boasts numerous (tacky) furnishings, including a large
four poster bed covered in thick hides and furs. Several chairs are
arranged around a table, which rests against the far wall, beneath a
large bear hide, presumably a trophy of the hunt.

A Dark Junction~
Inadequate lighting (perhaps due to fear that excessive torchlight 
poses a fire hazard) makes it difficult to see far in any direction
from this junction, though a bend in the corridor is apparent to the
west, and two doors can be seen to the south. Footsteps can be heard,
as if from nearby, though the heavy tread of a giant is audible some
distance away. Occasionally you can hear a raucous cry, coming from
somewhere to the north.

After a short distance the corridor bends, with branches disappearing
into the gloom to the north and west. A door is set in the south wall,
at the point where the two passages meet. A single torch burns low in
an iron sconce at this point, casting the only light visible within
a dozen or more yards. Cries and footsteps mingle with a loud snoring,
issued by slumbering giants.

Barracks Hall~
A total of ten large beds, piled high with hides, fill most of this
narrow hall, ample evidence of a barracks for some of the many giants
that inhabit this wooden keep. Dirty capes, smeared with grime from
days of travel, hang from hooks set in the walls, and large pairs of
muddy boots mar the floor. Several iron cressets line the walls, some
containing the smoldering stubs of torches.

The passage runs north, past at this point a door set in the west wall.
From behind the door issue cries and shouts of merriment, albeit with
a cruel edge to the laughter. The door is marked with another cryptic
rune, though the meaning of this one is a little more obvious- two small
giants being embraced by a larger. To strike at the young of this place
would certainly be a telling blow against the giants' morale.

Creche~
This long hall boasts a door at either end, and serves as the general
quarters of the giantish young, where they await the return of their
parents from the raids against humanity. Apparently serving as a sort
of training yard as well as playpen, the room boasts numerous make-
shift weapons mixed in with the toys. In fact, the weapons appear to
be considered toys themselves.

A Bend in the Corridor~
The corridor bends here, offering two possible destinations to those
brave enough to have penetrated this evil lair. Shouts and cries issue
at random intervals from the north, ample evidence of alert inhabitants.
It would be a change to catch the giants who live here awake; it seems
most of them spend a great deal of time in drunken stupors. The air is
thick with greasy smoke, the source of which is a smoldering brand near
your head.

The End of the Corridor~
The corridor ends abruptly, before a door set in the eastern wall,
which bears a crude marking that appears to represent giant childer.
These youths could well be the source of the hue and cry, though the
noise appears for the most part to be concentrated somewhere further
north, beyond the hide that covers the north wall.

The End of the Corridor~
At the northern end of this corridor, you are faced with two choices,
both of them wooden portals, set in the western and northern walls.
By now you estimate that you have penetrated at least halfway into the
steading, and must surely be nearing the mastermind of the dark race
that abides here. Hopefully, at any rate; the sooner you are able to
evacuate this foul structure the better; giants are poor company at 
the best of times.

Maids' Chamber~
This spacious chamber houses the many maids that serve the more 
important giants of the Steading, most notably the ruler and his
wife. Several beds line the walls, while two wardrobes hold the
clothing owned by those quartered here. The air is warmed by a
blazing fire in the hearth, and the air is thick with greasy smoke.
It would be fair to say that even the cleanest of hill giants appear
to prefer to live in squalor.

You pass into a spacious hall, that stretches in each direction save
the south, where it terminates in a wooden door. To the west lies a
brightly lit wing, which bends southward, and apparently houses the
belongings of a giant of importance; even from here numerous trophies
and tapestries are visible. To the west lies a large pair of double
doors, equal in dimension to those at the entrance to the Steading.
From behind them issue various sounds, including shouts, cries, moans
and belches.

Hall of the Chief~
This large hall boasts numerous features of interest. The walls and
floor are lined with rugs, hides and skins, while numerous tables and
wooden shelves labor under the weight of piles of pottery and dinner
ware. A long stone shelf above the hearth is lined with skulls, most
of them dwarven. Several stools are arranged around a table which bears
a crude map of the region; at last some evidence of the mastermind that
is behind these raids. But surely a mere hill giant would not possess
significant intelligence to orchestrate such a campaign of terror? A
large wooden door lies to the north, apparently leading to the chief's
private quarters.

Hall of the Chief~
More trophies and curios fill this end of the hall, which ends in a
large door to the south, presumably the abode of the chief's wife.
Like most of the doors in this place, it does not appear to be locked
or barred. Then again, only the most foolish would risk incurring the

dimly lit in comparison to the north.

A Dark Chamber~
The interior of this room is unlit, and what little light filters in
from the hallway casts illumination across only the first third of
what is a large bedchamber. Filled with stolen wooden furniture that
came from a dozen raids, it also boasts many stuffed footstools, rugs
and a table lined with chairs. The door to this room opens inwards,
making it impossible to see what may be lurking behind it.

Chamber of the Chief~
This chamber is littered with furs, hides and numerous weapons. More
hides and cloaks hang from pegs on the wall, which are spaced in 
between numerous metal cressets which support unlit torches. A thick
iron chain is set in one wall, presumably to tether the chief's bear.
On the western wall rests a large cupboard, apparently empty. Next to
it hangs a heavy bearskin.

Running north and south, this passage heads towards a door in each
direction. Side passages on the western wall can also be seen from
here, through the smoky illumination. The floor is bare, and of
wood rather than the packed dirt found elsewhere. Far to the north,
a beast howls, in anger or pain.

A Side Passage~
At this point the passage branches, and you can head west or south,
or through the barred door to the north; barred from this side, as
if to keep out whatever beast is howling beyond it. A heavy ring of
iron hangs from the roof, evidently used to sound an alarm, in the
event that those trapped to the north manage to escape their prison.
To the west, the passage ends almost immediately before a wooden door.

The Chief's Private Council Chambers~
This long narrow hall continues to the south, and at this point is
mostly filled with a long table, around which are arranged eight
chairs, two of them much larger and placed at each end. A rough skin
map of the region hangs above the fireplace, while shelves surrounding
the room are filled with various tokens and scraps, taken during the
many raids carried out by the giants. More trophies are also here, the
most noticeable being a manticore hide hanging on the western wall.

descending down to a subterranean level. Also present is a pile of
logs, and a strange symbol on the wall, unfamiliar yet still strangely
disturbing. There is something sinister about this room.

This end of the chamber is filled with trophies- numerous hides and
furs, as well as several stone statues that were stolen from a town
that was recently raided. A large wooden door to the west bears the
image of crossed sword and club, evidence of its status as an armory
of some sort. Dim illumination filters in through a skylight in the
high ceiling of this place.

Numerous capes, shields, spears and clubs fill this small room, which
belong to the chief. Used on the hunt as well as in war, the items in
this room are for the most part useless, due partially to their size
but also due to their poor condition and crude make. Some of them are
stolen, however, crafted by superior smiths and of a reasonable degree

This shadowy corridor is twice as wide as the great portals that open
onto it, but is apparently deserted. The same cannot be said of the
hall at lies at the end of it, to the north. A great deal of light and
noise comes from this direction, evidence of a well-illuminated site
of feasting, undoubtedly by giants. Surely this is where the bulk of
the giants must presently be concentrated. A single door set in the
western wall provides an alternate route.

An Armory~
This room is filled with wooden racks laden with giant-sized weapons,
ranging from axes and swords to great spears, clubs and two handed
swords. Iron maces and hammers rest nearby, along with sheafs of long
hunting spears. The far wall is lined with shields, again giant-sized,
and thus useless to human-sized creatures, but also undesirable even
by those capable of using them due to their poor quality. A single door
lies to the north, another to the east. A thorough search may turn up a
decent weapon or two.

Approaching the Great Hall~
The corridor nears the central hall of the steading, where the bulk
of the giants spend much of their free time carousing. It is here 
that you will find the chieftain of these foul beasts, and perhaps
also the source behind their sudden uprising against the lands of 
man. The air is smoky, and carries the stench of burning flesh, as
several dwarven carcasses are roasted within the hall to the north.

entrance to the noisy feast hall to the west. It would be advisable
to tread carefully indeed here; judging by the cacophony of sound, it
is filled with giants, and their servants. Back east lie the mostly
deserted quarters of the chief and his wife.

watch, laden down with heavy plates of bread and cheeses. They give
you a wide berth, assuming you to be an ally of the giants that now
feast within the hall. To the north, the hall continues, heading to
the residences of the servants and other menial persons.

of much noise- laughter, shouts and the clatter of pots and pans.

torches set in sconces on the walls, which appear to be treated with
a resin that renders them resistant to fire, a wise precaution. A
bound wooden door to the south appears to be different from the other
doors.

Several beds fill this chamber, arranged about a fire place, which is

are filled with the clothing of the visiting giants quartered here. A
single table, matched by four chairs, bears numerous gaming devices,
and beneath it lies yet another chest. Doubtless some item of small
interest may well be turned up by a thorough search, but it would be
a timely venture.

race of said foes, and it wouldn't surprise you to find a halfling or
even a dwarf on the spit somewhere.

matrons supervise the food preparation, chopping and placing foodstuffs
on heavy platters, which the orcs then struggle to carry out to the
great hall. Counters covered in appropriate kitchenware fill the large

Lair of the Wolves~
This open compound is floored with packed earth, and boasts only the

is littered with bones, most of them orcish, and more than a few
pools of dried blood, staining the earth a dark crimson. Large hunks
gnawed meat lie scattered about the place.

portcullis fills the western wall, and from beyond it issues a volley
of howls and shrieks, made by some ferocious beast. The air here is
dank and stale; the stench of soured wine lingers strongly. A slight
breeze, however, can be detected, passing through a narrow crack in
the wall to the east.

as well as broken weapons and dented armor, doubtless considered to be

The horrid beasts that lurk in the pens seem loathe to trespass upon

reason to fear this room, through training by whip and fire. Giants

of worthless copper pieces and the occasional cracked or chipped gem.

This small chamber is apparently the office of a giant of some small
degree of importance. A large desk (a table supported by two barrels,
actually) covers the far wall, lined by several chairs, while the
walls are lined with whips, chains and the ubiquitious cloaks, hides
and furs. Every item in this place shows signs of heavy usage, and
are in poor condition at best. The place also smells- no, reeks- of

connecting with rock, and the sawing of wooden supports for the roof.

Progress down this empty corridor confirms your earlier suspicions-
this rubble-strewn section of the Steading is indeed deserted. A
thick layer of dust coats the rubble, evidence of past construction
that was abandoned for some reason, most probably laziness. There
is little evidence of any items of use; however a set of footprints,
elf-sized in fact, heading north indicates that at least one other
person has dared this empty hall.

The corridor branches here, with a second passage heading northwest,
into the darkness. To the north, the passage heads towards a set of
stairs, barely visible from here, heading upward a few feet to a
raised area, the contents of which cannot be deciphered. The tracks
in the dust eschew this route, heading instead to the northwest, the
maker of the tracks having apparently not cared whether progress he
or she made was visible to others; elves can move so as to leave no
trace of their passage if they so wish.

soft splash will echo down the corridor, its source unknown. Perhaps
this was once a source of water for the giants, abandoned when a
more convenient source was found.

The steps rise to the edge of a circular, giant-made chamber, then
head down the other side into the basin of the well, which is mostly
filled with a deep pool of dark water. Water flows into the pool
through hidden, equally artificial, inlets, and the overflow from
here drains off into a shallow trench that circles the cistern, which
in turn runs off down several small holes. The air is cool, and quite
pleasant.

A Dark Hallway~
The hallway, and the tracks, terminate in this chamber, which apparently
serves as a storeroom of some sort, used to contain little-used items.
The mysterious elf apparently deposited several sacks of chisels and
hand drills, forged from a strange black metal and arranged near the
far wall, where the tracks end. Crates and containers filled with other
mining tools lie about, some covered in dust, others recently disturbed.
The bulk of the tools needed by the stone giants are carried by them; those
stored here are surplus, hence their state of disuse. A single door
lies to the north.

are all marked with a bung seal impressed with a death's head, which
may well be an indication of the strength of this alcohol. Strange
glyphs similar to those outside mark the sides. Whoever owns these

This corridor, like most of those under the Steading, is for the most
part either partially or totally unlit, forcing you to move slowly
through the gloom, relying solely on your own light source, which seems
feeble in the face of this encompassing darkness. Sounds of warriors
moving about, on errands of their own or the giants' behest, echo all
around you; it will be very difficult to avoid detection for very long

and hand axes at those who may launch an assault from this direction.
But who (or what) would be threatening the giants and their allies so
deeply within the Steading?

Sleeping Area~
Several open doorways lead onto the chambers of the bugbears that
serve the giants of the Steading. There are always many of them 
here; bugbears are slothful beasts, and not prone to working for
long hours, or with any regularity. A foul smell, which includes
wine, urine and blood, assaults your nostrils.

At this point the hall becomes brighter, as the light sources become
both stronger and more frequent, including several bullhorn lanterns,
hanging from hooks set in the ceiling. Sounds of metalworking echo
from down a side branch to the southwest, the loud clanging ringing
in your ears. To the west, the corridor continues for a short distance
before terminating in a wide chamber, the specifics of which are not
immediately apparent from here.

The corridor passes into a series of interlinked chambers, which are
for the most part piled high with all manner of tools and equipment.
Long benches laden with piles of iron line the walls, while numerous
forges, accompanied by large bellows, can be seen. Heavy iron hammers
dangle from hooks set in the walls, as do many whips, oddly enough. A
long wooden beam set with pairs of manacles is apparently used here to
bind slaves used as manual labor in the production of weapons.

The Armory~
This section of the armory is where the giant in charge "works"; in
fact, he spends large amounts of time lazing about and drinking, while
the dwarven slaves labor endlessly to the north. Giants, hill giants at
least, are poor smiths indeed compared to the dwarves, and as such it
makes a good deal of sense for them to use the dwarves' superior skills.
This workspace hasn't seen a lot of work; a cloth has been draped over a
bench, and several mugs of ale and some dice arranged there.

The Smithy~
This smoky chamber is dominated by rows of spears, hammers and axes,
obviously of dwarven make, in various stages of (dis)repair. The giant
charged with their care is apparently rather dedicated, for a giant; 
numerous tasks appear to be in the process of being completed, and the
tools all look well used, and recently too. A large forge in the wall
near the entrance radiates immense waves of heat and smoke.

A Long Hallway~
The hall here boasts another branch, running north towards what from
here looks like a cell block. Guards can be seen, bugbears it seems,
standing before heavy wooden doors set in the walls. The giants are
lazy creatures, relying heavily on slave labor to complete even the
most basic of tasks. Thus they expend a great deal of time and money
ensuring that these slaves are kept under control, though it seems,
judging from the turmoil to the east, that they aren't always entirely
successful.

This high-ceiling chamber is filled with all manner of the requisite
trappings of torture chambers. Racks, maidens, iron chairs and chains
fill most of the area, along with a workbench covered with knives and
screws, branding irons and pliers. Several braziers filled with coals
complete the picture, as do numerous whips dangling from the walls. A
heavy iron bracket hanging from the ceiling enables them to dangle
even very tall prisoners (such as fellow giants).

Slave Quarters~
This chamber boasts three wooden doors, set in the walls, opening
presumably onto chambers containing orc slaves in the process of
being "trained". Howls and cries echo from the cells, as the many
unwilling prisoners express their opinions on their predicament.
Orcs are vile creatures, for certain, but few creatures deserve the
fate of serving the abominable hill giants.

This side of the blockade, there is evidence of many recent battles.
Corpses lie scattered across the floor, along with broken weapons and
rent shields and shattered helms. Pools of dried blood have collected,
adding to the foul stench that permeates this area. A revolt of some
sort is apparently in full effect.
 
To the east, the corridor passes into a series of natural caverns.

This long narrow corridor is unlit, and boasts little of interest,
save for a pile of rubble to the southwest, hastily erected by the
orcish rebels, to keep out some unknown peril. A vile smell issues
from the rubble, though it seems to be coming from behind the rubble
rather than from within it.
 
To the southeast, the corridor ends as it passes into a large natural
cavern.

Strange purplish rock, shifting and morphing as you watch, surrounds
you, covered in writhing black murals of a loathsome and disturbing
nature. A deathly chill issues from them; you can already see why the
orcs felt it necessary to blockade this foul place. A yellowish altar
rises to the west, while the area to the south has collapsed, and is
mostly filled with rubble. It doesn't appear as if anyone has ventured
here for quite some time, though there is, curiously enough, no dust
covering the greasy stone floor or walls.

The altar rises here, atop three shallow ridged steps, verily glowing
with evil, a pulsating warmth issuing from the yellowish stone. The
walls are a sickly shade of mauve, and writhe with violet amorphous
forms, twisting and crying out in a dire cacophony of unholy sound. A
single glance at the far wall, covered with glassy black tentacle-like
reliefs, causes your very mind to become temporarily unhinged; tarrying
here overlong could result in far worse.

The blackened stone of the ceiling collapsed here some time ago, thus
blocking the stairway at the end with tons of rubble. What little can
be seen of the uncovered walls is enough to make you glad you cannot
see more. Disgusting murals, of writhing batlike creatures copulating
in obscene fashion with hapless humans of both genders, cover them, as
do scenes of torture and mutilation, of demons rampaging through the
towns of humans and elves.

This section of the caves is devoid of orcish inhabitants; instead,
there are piles of fungus present, arranged as beds by the odiferous
troglodytes that now lair within. Hated and feared by the orcs to
the south, they have become trapped here, and are biding their time
until they can make a break for it, fleeing the dungeon altogether.
The cave continues to the northwest, and in the northeast corner a
body of water can be seen; a stream you could dive into.

Dragging your soaked body up onto the shore, you gaze about at where
the river has deposited you, wondering how you are going to get back;
the current is far too strong to swim against. Bones and other debris
lie scattered all over the floor; it would seem you are far from the
first lost soul to become stranded here. A dull roar reverberates 
throughout the chamber, sounding much like a waterfall, which you now

in size and force as it travelled downwards.

A Secret Cavern~
The cavern terminates here, before a solid wall of natural stone, which
is covered in the now-familiar lichens, fungus and molds, none of which
appear to be anything other than the normal subterranean varieties. You
have heard rumors in many taverns of growths of similar nature that can
inflict great harm if inhaled, ingested or even ventured near; at least
you appear to be free from such a threat here. This still doesn't offer
a way out of here, though the collection of debris lying everywhere does
offer a way to spend the time, searching through it all.

This narrow hall heads towards a darkened corridor, littered with

of yet more guards, and potentially more peril.

The Top of the Hill~
You reach the top quicker than you anticipated, and find yourself
staring at the great wooden doors that bar entrance to the steading,
some thirty yards to the west. Gazing at the structure, you note that
it is quite large, stretching back for at least two hundred yards,
indicating that a large volume of giants and their dark allies may well
lair within the wooden walls. Constructed over a series of years, the
Steading has been treated with a substance that renders the wood quite
resistant to flame, and would frustrate any attempt to ignite it; a 
wise precaution indeed.

Climbing the Stair~
A stiff breeze catches at you as you warily climb the stone steps, and
more than once you slip and almost tumble back down. The steps are
worn smooth by decades of use, and you wonder how many doughty souls
before you have attempted a crusade against these foul beasts, only to
perish deep in their foul lair. Who knows what dangers may lie within
the dark wooden keep atop the hill?

Approaching the Hill~
At this point you find a set of steps cut into the side of the hill,
allowing for an easy ascent to the Steading itself, should you so
wish. Birds of prey circle far overhead, as if, having observed such
behavior before, they are expecting an imminent feast. The steps are
much larger than even a troll would need, and progress would be quite
tricky for a halfling, who would have to literally climb each one. 
This is another indication of the giantish nature of the inhabitants
of the Steading.

The trail ends here, at the base of a small hill, atop which rests a
great wooden citadel, visible clearly even from the base, such is its
size. A chill breeze suddenly gusts along the trail, and you shiver
without realizing as you regard this place, surely the abode of a fell
tribe of hill giants. Rumors of giantish insurrection have plagued the
land for months; mayhap you have stumbled upon their source?
